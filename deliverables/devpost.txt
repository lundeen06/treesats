Project Story

## Inspiration

Tens of thousands of satellites orbit Earth today. SpaceX alone plans **1 million** by 2030. At that scale, ground-based collision avoidance doesn't work—especially when GPS and communications jamming is expanding across Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and Myanmar, affecting even commercial satellites.

Satellites can't wait for ground commands when collision windows are measured in minutes. They need autonomous self-defense.

## What it does

**StarGuard** provides three autonomous capabilities using only onboard star tracker cameras:

1. **Collision Detection** - YOLOv8 detects satellites/debris in star tracker imagery, BoT-SORT tracks objects across frames, UKF estimates trajectories from angles-only measurements
2. **Collision Avoidance** - Convex optimization computes fuel-optimal evasive maneuvers
3. **Threat Assessment** - NVIDIA Cosmos VLM classifies satellite types and assesses maneuver intent

No GPS. No ground link. Just existing spacecraft hardware operating autonomously.

## How we built it

**Orbital Simulation**: Used Tensorgator (GPU-accelerated Keplerian propagator) to simulate 10,000+ satellite constellations and generate synthetic training data.

**Synthetic Data Pipeline**: Built a pinhole camera model to render 256×256 star tracker images from observer frame. Auto-labeled via brightness thresholding—satellites appear as bright spots against black space.

**Computer Vision**: Fine-tuned YOLOv8 for tiny satellite detection, integrated BoT-SORT for persistent tracking across frames. Extracts pixel coordinates → bearing angles (elevation/azimuth).

**Angles-Only Navigation**: Reconstructs full 6-DOF state from sequential images:
- 1 photo → bearing angles
- 2 photos → bearing + depth → position vector
- 3 photos → finite difference → position + velocity

**State Estimation**: Implemented Unscented Kalman Filter that fuses orbital dynamics (Keplerian propagation) with star tracker measurements for noise-resistant trajectory estimates.

**Collision Avoidance**: Built convex optimization solver (CVXPY) for minimum-ΔV maneuvers subject to collision constraints, fuel budgets, and thrust limits.

**Threat Assessment**: Integrated NVIDIA Cosmos Reason VLM via vLLM for real-time satellite classification from proximity imagery.

## Challenges we ran into

**Angles-Only Navigation**: Reconstructing 3D trajectories from 2D bearing angles is ill-posed. Solved by leveraging temporal information across multiple frames and constraining solutions with orbital dynamics.

**GPU Orbital Mechanics**: Kepler's equation (`M = E - e sin E`) requires iterative numerical methods. Optimized Newton-Raphson for CUDA with vectorized operations across 10k+ satellites.

**Tiny Object Detection**: Satellites appear as 3-5 pixel bright spots. Required careful YOLOv8 hyperparameter tuning and augmentation strategies.

**Real-Time Performance**: Star tracker processing, detection, tracking, and maneuver planning must happen in real-time onboard. Achieved through efficient model selection and GPU acceleration.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- **End-to-end autonomy**: Raw pixels → executed maneuvers with no human in the loop
- **Zero manual labeling**: Fully automated synthetic data pipeline
- **Scalability**: Handles mega-constellations (10,000+ satellites) on consumer GPUs
- **Production-ready**: Uses only existing spacecraft hardware (star trackers)

## What we learned

- GPU parallelization transforms orbital simulation from hours to seconds
- Sequential observations + dynamics constraints enable angles-only navigation
- Star tracker imagery is ideal for object detection—high contrast, known background
- Convex optimization guarantees globally optimal collision avoidance solutions
- VLMs can run efficiently enough for real-time onboard inference

## What's next for TreeSats

- Embedded deployment on radiation-hardened flight computers
- Multi-sensor fusion (star tracker + IMU + magnetometer)
- Cooperative avoidance protocols for inter-satellite coordination
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing on satellite testbeds
