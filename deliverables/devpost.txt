Project Story

## The Problem

Tens of thousands of satellites orbit Earth today. SpaceX alone plans **1 million** by 2030. At that scale, ground-based collision avoidance doesn't work—especially when communications and GPS jamming are expanding across Ukraine, Taiwan, Iran, and Myanmar, now affecting commercial satellites.

**The constraints:**
- Satellites can't wait for ground commands when collisions are imminent
- Communication windows are limited or denied in contested regions
- GPS is unavailable or jammed
- Collision windows are measured in minutes, not hours

Current satellite operators rely on ground stations for collision warnings and maneuver commands. This doesn't scale to mega-constellations in communication-denied environments.

## The Solution

**StarGuard** provides autonomous collision avoidance and threat assessment using only onboard star tracker cameras—no ground link or GPS required.

**Three autonomous capabilities:**

1. **Collision Detection** - YOLOv8 detects satellites/debris in star tracker imagery, BoT-SORT tracks objects across frames, UKF estimates trajectories from angles-only measurements
2. **Collision Avoidance** - Convex optimization computes fuel-optimal evasive maneuvers
3. **Threat Assessment** - NVIDIA Cosmos VLM classifies satellite types and assesses maneuver intent

All processing happens onboard via edge compute using existing spacecraft hardware (star trackers).

## How It Works

**1. Orbital Simulation (Training Data Generation)**
Used Tensorgator (GPU-accelerated Keplerian propagator) to simulate 10,000+ satellite constellations and generate synthetic training data for sensors. Built a pinhole camera model to render 256×256 star tracker images from the satellite's frame, auto-labeled via brightness thresholding—satellites appear as bright spots against space.

**2. Computer Vision Pipeline (Detection & Tracking)**
Fine-tuned YOLOv8 for tiny satellite detection (3-5 pixel objects), integrated BoT-SORT for persistent tracking across frames. Extracts pixel coordinates → bearing angles (elevation/azimuth).

**3. Angles-Only Navigation (State Reconstruction)**
Reconstructs full 6-DOF state from sequential images:
- 1 photo → bearing angles
- 2 photos → bearing + depth → position vector
- 3 photos → finite difference → position + velocity

**4. State Estimation (Trajectory Prediction)**
Unscented Kalman Filter fuses orbital dynamics (Keplerian propagation) with star tracker measurements for noise-resistant trajectory estimates and collision prediction.

**5. Collision Avoidance (Maneuver Planning)**
Convex optimization solver (CVXPY) computes minimum-ΔV maneuvers subject to collision constraints, fuel budgets, and thrust limits.

**6. Threat Assessment (Object Classification)**
NVIDIA Cosmos Reason VLM via vLLM provides real-time satellite classification from proximity operations imagery—identifies satellite types and assesses maneuver intent.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

**Angles-Only Navigation**: Reconstructing 3D trajectories from 2D bearing angles is ill-posed. Solved by leveraging temporal information across multiple frames and constraining solutions with orbital dynamics.

**GPU Orbital Mechanics**: Kepler's equation (`M = E - e sin E`) requires iterative numerical methods. Optimized Newton-Raphson for CUDA with vectorized operations across 10k+ satellites—reducing simulation time from hours to seconds.

**Tiny Object Detection**: Satellites appear as 3-5 pixel bright spots in star tracker imagery. Required careful YOLOv8 hyperparameter tuning and augmentation strategies for robust detection.

**Real-Time Onboard Performance**: Star tracker processing, detection, tracking, and maneuver planning must happen in real-time onboard with limited compute. Achieved through efficient model selection, GPU acceleration, and edge compute optimization.

## Key Results

- **End-to-end autonomy**: Raw pixels → executed maneuvers with no human in the loop
- **Fully automated pipeline**: Zero manual labeling—synthetic data generation with auto-labeling
- **Scalability**: Handles mega-constellations (10,000+ satellites) on consumer GPUs
- **Production-ready**: Uses only existing spacecraft hardware (star trackers)
- **Communication-independent**: Operates without GPS or ground contact

## Impact

StarGuard enables satellites to operate autonomously in communication-denied environments—critical for mega-constellations, commercial satellites over contested regions, and national security missions where ground contact is limited or unavailable.

## Technical Insights

- GPU parallelization transforms orbital simulation from hours to seconds
- Sequential observations + dynamics constraints enable angles-only navigation
- Star tracker imagery is ideal for object detection—high contrast, known background
- Convex optimization guarantees globally optimal collision avoidance solutions
- VLMs can run efficiently enough for real-time onboard inference and complex threat assessments

## What's Next

- Embedded deployment on radiation-hardened flight computers
- Multi-sensor fusion (star tracker + IMU + magnetometer)
- Cooperative avoidance protocols for inter-satellite coordination
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing on satellite testbeds
